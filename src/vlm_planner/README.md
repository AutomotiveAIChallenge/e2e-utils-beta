# VLM Planner

VLM-based trajectory planner for autonomous driving.

## Overview

The VLM Planner generates complete trajectories from scratch using VLM inference based on camera images and vehicle state. Unlike trajectory selectors that choose from candidates, this planner creates entirely new trajectory paths.

## Features

- Complete trajectory generation from camera input
- Vehicle state awareness (velocity, acceleration)
- 5-second lookahead trajectory planning
- Smooth trajectory point generation with proper timing
- Race track sector detection and navigation
- Real-time trajectory publishing

## Setup

### Environment Setup

```sh
uv venv -p python3.10
```

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```sh
uv pip install .
```

### Set Gemini API Key

```sh
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Usage

**Files:**
- `vlm_planner_node.py` - Main ROS 2 node
- `vlm_planner.py` - VLM trajectory generation logic
- `prompt.py` - Trajectory generation prompts and utilities

**Run:**
```sh
# Run the VLM planner node with custom output topic
python vlm_planner_node.py --ros-args -p output_topic:="/planning/ml_planner/auto/trajectory"
```

**Topics:**
- Subscribe:
  - `/sensing/camera/image_raw` (Image)
  - `/localization/kinematic_state` (Odometry)
  - `/localization/acceleration` (AccelWithCovarianceStamped)
- Publish:
  - `/output/trajectory` (Trajectory)

**Parameters:**
- `output_topic`: Output trajectory topic (default: `/output/trajectory`)
- Inference interval: 5.0 seconds (configurable in code)

## Track Knowledge

This component includes knowledge of a 13-sector race track:

1. Starting Straight
2. R-Hairpin (with white sign landmark)
3. Short Straight
4. L-Hairpin
5. Short Straight
6. U-shaped Right
7. 90-degree Left
8. R-Hairpin
9. L-Hairpin
10. S-Curve (L->R)
11. 90-degree Right
12. S-Curve (L->R)
13. Sweeping Right Corner

## Architecture

```
Camera Image + Vehicle State → VLM (Gemini) → Trajectory Generation → ROS 2 Message → Autoware
```

The VLM Planner uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite model for fast inference while maintaining accuracy for autonomous driving trajectory generation.

## Development

- `VLMPlanner` class handles trajectory generation using Gemini
- `VlmPlannerNode` handles ROS 2 communication and vehicle state management
- Trajectory points include 3D coordinates, timing, and velocity information

## Dependencies

- ROS 2
